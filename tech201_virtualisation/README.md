## DevOps

cloud - secure data centers that sell their own data space and services to offer security and variety on the cloud.
On premise - all datat is managed by the company 

aspects you want to improve as a DevOps engineer:

- Ease of use - Other teams are going to use the tools we create. They won't use them if they aren't user friendly - If the devs do not use our tools then there will be headaches/delays in deployment down the line.

- Flexibility - It can be easy to get locked into using a specific product, tool or software. And it then becomes hard for the company to keep up with industry changes - Everything the company uses should be easily changed or updated as the business needs change

- Robustness - We need as close to 100% uptime as possible for our company's service - We are responsible for achieving this as DevOps engineers

- Cost - Cost is often overlooked. We need to make sure the company is being as efficient as possible in its tech design - Foe example how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task? Do we need certain servers running? etc.

Risk registers are important to understand the risks the company may face and how likely they are to happen


# Dev Environments

An area where developers are able to write/run and test code. DevOps engineers create these environments for the developer teams. we prepare the applications/ extensions they need for this space. By doing this we can standardise the developer teams communication and collaboration.
