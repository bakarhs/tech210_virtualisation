## DevOps

cloud - secure dtata centers that sell their own data space and services to offer security and variety on the cloud.
On premise - all datat is managed by the company 

aspects you want to improve as a DevOps engineer:

- Ease of use - Other teams are going to use the tools we create. They wont use them if they aren't user friendly - If the devs do not use our tools then there will be headaches/delays in deplloyment down the line.

- Flexability - It can be easy to get locked into using a specific product, tool or software. And it then becomes hard for the company to keep up with industy changes - Everything the company uses should be easliy changed or updated as the business needs change

- Robustness - We need as close to 100% uptime as possible for our company's service - We are responsible for acheiving this as DevOps engineers

- Cost - Cost is often overlooked. We need to make sure the company is being as efficiant as possible in its tech design - Foe example how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task? Do we need certain servers running? etc.

Risk registers are important to understand the risks the comany may face and how likely they are to happen
